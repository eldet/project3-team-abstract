## CIS 163 Winter 2020 - Project 3

This project focuses on a camping reservation system.
You must start with the existing code, you cannot
start from scratch.

Your project will primarily be graded according to the
rubric; however, the instructor reserves the right
to modify grades based on knowledge of the code, 
student contributions to the code, and team member ratings.
